## 💬 Q&A Today

### Q1: What are Atlas browser's main features? Is it free? Is it based on Chrome?

**A**:
- **Core Features**:
  - **In-page AI assistance**: Invoke ChatGPT on any webpage without switching tabs, automatically understands page content
  - **Browser memory**: Remembers visited pages and context, cross-session reference (e.g., "find job posts I viewed last week")
  - **Agent mode**: AI can operate browser to complete tasks like search, add to cart, checkout

- **Pricing**:
  - Free: Basic features with usage limits
  - Plus ($20/month): Unlocks Agent mode, more message quota
  - Pro ($200/month): Nearly unlimited, priority access to latest models

- **Engine**: **NOT Chrome**, OpenAI's self-developed browser engine designed for AI integration

- **Availability in China**: Works but requires international network connection

### Q2: What's the difference between Atlas and Chrome + ChatGPT extension?

**A**:

| Feature | Free Atlas | Chrome + GPT Extension |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| In-page Q&A | ✅ Native integration | ✅ Basic support |
| Page understanding | ✅ Automatic | ⚠️ Manual share/copy |
| Browser memory | ✅ Cross-page context | ❌ None |
| Conversation continuity | ✅ Seamless | ⚠️ New tab each time |
| Experience | ✅ Smooth, no friction | ⚠️ Switching between apps |

**Key difference**:
- Atlas's AI knows what you're looking at, just ask "how much is this"
- Extension requires selecting text, clicking share, or copy-paste

### Q3: What is OCR and its use cases?

**A**:
- **OCR** = Optical Character Recognition
- **Process**: Detect text area → Recognize text → Post-processing
- **Typical use cases**:
  - Ticket backend entry (extract info from supplier posters)
  - Invoice/receipt processing (automated financial recognition)
  - User upload recognition (ticket numbers, ID cards, etc.)
- **Common tools**: PaddleOCR (Baidu, strong in Chinese), Tesseract (Google), Alibaba Cloud OCR, Tencent Cloud OCR

### Q4: What are OpenAI's current models? Is GPT-4o still available?

**A**:

**Current Models (February 2026)**:
| Model | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| GPT-5.2 Instant | General conversation | Updated Feb 10, faster and more natural |
| GPT-5.2 Thinking | Reasoning | Adjustable thinking depth for complex problems |
| GPT-5.3-Codex | Best coding model | Released Feb 5, code gen + reasoning combined |
| GPT-5.1-Codex-Max | Long-term projects | Multi-context window support for large projects |

**Retired Models**:
⚠️ Retired on Feb 13, 2026: GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, OpenAI o4-mini

### Boris Cherny Interview Deep Dive

**Source**: Lenny's Podcast - "What happens after coding is solved"  
**Guest**: Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator & head)  
**Date**: February 19, 2026

---

#### Core Insights

**1. "Coding is Solved"**
> "AI has practically solved coding"

- Claude Code accounts for **4%** of GitHub public commits
- DAU doubled last month
- Spotify says best developers haven't written code since December

**2. "Everyone is a Builder"**
> "Anyone can just build software anytime"

- Product managers can build prototypes directly
- Designers can generate runnable code with AI
- Startups no longer need technical co-founders

**3. "Software Engineer Job Title Will Go Away"**
> "Software engineer is going to start to go away in 2026"

- Not that engineers will be unemployed
- The **job title** "software engineer" will disappear
- Because **everyone can code**

**4. Transition Will Be Painful**
> "It's going to be very disruptive. It's going to be painful for a lot of people."

- Job descriptions will change rapidly starting 2026
- Need to relearn how to collaborate with AI
- Some people will be left behind

**5. Advice for Workers**
> "Don't be scared of them. Experiment with AI tools and learn how they function."

- Start using now
- Understand principles, not just usage
- Stay open, embrace change

#### Analogy: The Printing Press

Boris referenced Gutenberg's printing press:
- **Before**: Only monks could copy books (scarce skill)
- **After printing**: Anyone could spread ideas
- **Result**: Knowledge explosion, Renaissance

**AI coding = The printing press moment for software development**

---

#### Claude Code Product Philosophy

**1. Not IDE, Terminal Tool**
- Developers already work in terminal
- Fit existing habits, don't force workflow changes

**2. "Unlimited Tokens" for Teams**
- Traditional: Limit AI usage to control costs
- Boris's approach: Let teams use freely
- Result: Teams find more use cases, faster iteration

**3. Less Features, More Depth**
- Don't chase feature count
- Perfect core experience

#### From Claude Code to Cowork

| Product | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Claude Code | AI assistant for programmers |
| Cowork | AI colleague for everyone |

**What Cowork can do**:
- Not just coding
- Operate computers, use software, complete tasks
- Like a "digital intern"

#### Boris's Personal Experience

**Left Anthropic for Cursor, returned after two weeks**
- Briefly joined Cursor (competitor) in 2024
- Found Cursor's culture didn't fit
- Returned to Anthropic after two weeks

**Reasons**:
- Anthropic focuses on **safety** and **long-term value**
- Cursor pursues **rapid growth**

#### Three Team Principles

Boris shares with every new team member:

1. **Underfund teams** — Limited resources drive creativity
2. **Give unlimited tokens** — Let teams freely explore AI possibilities
3. **Focus on depth, not breadth** — Perfect one feature rather than many
